# Pose Library Template for Blender

Addon for creating and managing library poses for Blender 3D Animation Software.

![Pose Library Overview](images/pose_library_overview.png)

Blender's [Pose Library](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library.html) allows artists to store and retrieve poses to use in animation. It's an extremely valuable tool for teams to ensure consistency with their character's poses, and provides a streamlined workflow for blending in and out of poses. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to manage multiple poses, and re-creating poses quickly can become time consuming.

This addon provides a user friendly, panel-based UI for creating and managing poses. It allows teams to use a consistent template to generate poses all at once.
