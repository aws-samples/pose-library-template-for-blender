# General Workflow
1. **Create** a new Blender file.
2. **Link** or **Append** a character.
   * If linked, enable **Library Overrides**. To learn more about Library Overrides, see the Blender [Library Overrides Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/files/linked_libraries/library_overrides.html).
3. **Select** a control on the character and switch to **Pose mode**.
4. Go to the **Pose Library panel** in the 3D viewport.
5. Create **Categories** and **Poses** for the character.
   * Note: Speed up the process by importing the default template.
6. Place up the **Camera** appropriately for each Category.
7. Specify the **Display Layers** for each Category.
8. Create 3D poses for the character for each pose.
   * Navigate to the first frame (100).
   * Create a default pose.
   * Go to frame 101.
   * Create the next pose.
   * *Repeat this process for every pose.*
9.  Choose **Create Pose Library** to generate the library.
10. Specify a location in **Edit -> Preferences -> File Paths -> Asset Libraries** to save the library files.
11. **Save** the file in the location for **Asset Libraries**.
